# lunch_bot

This small program can be used to decide where to go to lunch with colleagues.
It creates a list of restaurants in your vicinity.

You will need a google places key for this script to work-- as it uses the
google places API. If you do not have one
yet you can obtain them and more infos about the underlying API here:
